Amnesiac TODO/BUGS/Projects/Procrastinating list.

Meaning of flags:
! = fixed/added stuff
+ = changed stuff, uncertain if complete.
@ = requests/votes
$ = knownbug.
? = undecided/closed votes.

## low priority knownbugs.
$ Supposedly texp will break under certain circumstances
$ userlist is buggy/has been having issues for years it's really not a
  priority for us but we may work on it soon.

## high priority knownbugs.
None

## high priority todo. (stuff that needs to done before upcoming release)
@ not exactly a high priority however we should prolly merge in a supposidly
  working/better userlist than the one we have right now. //zak

@ we have too many bindings for dcc, perhaps we could set some sort of cycle
  for chat/accept/send, as i highly doubt more than one person would send
  some sort of dcc request at once in most cases, ie; use ctrl-t to accept
  both chat/files and ctrl-r to reject both chat/files? something to look
  into? //zak

@ more documentation need some updating? //zak

## lower priority requests.
@ Finish server list module, assigned to kreca

@ add bans help documentation

@ add some topwin module, kreca has to start a discussion about some topwin
  script he might have permission for us to use/modify/rip ;)

@ make orignick use ISON functionality.. -Rylan

@ Get some variables from numeric 005 so we can finetune some displays?
  EG, get nick length so we can have formatted publics and /who with proper
  output? <-- i crapple vote yay. "while shielding myself from kreca"

@ Add a way to match the ban/invite execption list against the current
  users in a channel. Requested by Tilt.

## Procrastinated requests.
@ add support to bwk to allow usage of wildcards.
@ fixdouble/fixwin or equiv for doublestats
@ finish up or scrap the adcc module, i really hate to touch this myself
  i have never heard of a request for this module nor have i heard a single
  complaint about it working or not working perhaps a vote?

## bugs fixed. / projects done.
1.24.08 - seems to work fine, let us know if any problems.
! add possible dcc_ports toggability, somewhat based off epic5/scripts.
   let me or kreca know if it works/causes problems/whatnot //zak
   (still untested for me really)

1.12.08 it's been set for default_realname/user, -snapshot is more for
	-cvs epic anyways. (were not adding backwards compat)
! fixup /set realname for default_realname and default_user should we
  if < ver, or break compatability? i vote for if < somever when it was
  added then do the old way of set realname.

4.17.07
! refix /wall fix formats to make use of + or the like for on
  public_other "% @*" may get rid of /wall2 and the current notice hook
  as apparently a lot of ircd's now support /msg @#chan for walls.
  //kreca . See ChangeLog for more info

3.20.07 - i beleive kreca fixed this as well as above.
! merge in the new userlist more cleanly some errors i have ran into:
  /save sometimes shows usersave nonexistent when its not loaded? or loaded?
  /addmod userlist sometimes spew weird help/something errors i forget.
  savefile issues with a line that needs to be remove manually to fix.

3.20.07
! possible way to make /delmod urlgrab actually unload completely?? for
  some of us who runs multiple epic clients on the same box. a la on hook
  unloading issue???
  Fixed by adding unload hook to the module framework //kreca

1.31.07
! mmatrix module, /addword foobar #chan will not ban and kick user, just kick
  ^^ fixed prolly about a month or two ago //zak

1.30.07
! add auto_rejoin_on_connect toggability [on/off] (reconnect script)

10.21.06 - fixed by kreca 'getuhost' issue in alias.m -Rylan
! /ign seems to have interesting issues, recursion?? /ign foo-bar(nonexistent
  nick) spews Cannot pop operand: no more operands, looks like there's some
  hack to suppress even more errors a la ^?; math parser issue? -Rylan

9.14.06 seems to work fine, hopefully some will like this feature //zak
! make usage of $encode() for basic 'encryption' for awaylogs or some other
  new function that has yet to be investigated.

7.10.06 //skullY
! =nick= bug: if you use /msg nic<tab> and their nick ends in a \
  =nick= it prefixes it with another \, so it'll be nick\\

8/7/05 doesn't look like this is needed move to here votes closed. //zak
- maybe? for - glines...
  <@skullY> you could if ([$0]==[y] || [$0]==[yes]) //vote?

and of course!
UNSURPRISING BUG FIXES.
