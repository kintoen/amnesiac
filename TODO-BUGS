Amnesiac TODO/BUGS/Projects/Procrastinating list.

Rewrite Section:

This is some notes from hop on stuff we should look at rewriting.

<hop> in serverlist.m, i'd love to know why you're torturing the poor FULLDESC
      return value like that. ;-)
<hop> if the return value isn't usable, i'd rather fix the return value than
      require you to murder it.
<hop> so there is a $serverctl(READ_FILE filename)
<hop> and if you write all of the $serverctl(GET <refnum> FULLDESC) to that
      file, it'll Just Work(tm).
-----
<hop> $N is *never* what you think it is.
<hop> $servernick() is what you should use
-----
<hop> btw, the same deal with $C  -- $C is the current input window's current
      channel.  what you want is $winchan($serverwin())
-----
<hop> 1) You can create your own output levels with $levelctl()
<hop> http://epicsol.org/help/levelctl
<hop> ie, @levelctl(ADD bleh);/xecho -l bleh HAHAHAH!                           
-----
<hop>  /server irc.foo.com:pr=v6
<hop> or /server ssl-irc.foo.com:type=irc-ssl
-----
<hop> you should begin planning for elimiating every use of /eval everywhere    
<hop> if you need to double-expand strings, use the ** math operator            
<hop> @ foo = 'this is a string with $var in it'                                
<hop> @ var = "one"                                                             
<hop> @ val1 = **foo                                                            
<hop> @ var = "two"                                                             
<hop> @ val2 == **foo                                                           
<hop> val1 -> "this is a string with one in it"  val2 -> "this is a string
      with two in it"

Meaning of flags:
! = fixed/added stuff
+ = changed stuff, uncertain if complete.
@ = requests/votes
$ = knownbug.
? = undecided/closed votes.

## low priority knownbugs.
$ Supposedly texp will break under certain circumstances <-- vague 
  kreca motherland speak, a little clarification here would 
  be nice //zak

$ userlist is buggy/has been having issues for years it's really not a
  priority for us but we may work on it soon. <- 02.03.10, eh mon, we
  love to talk about it, it comes up almost every time i come on irc,
  2015, it will be done in 2015. //zak

## high priority knownbugs.
None

## high priority todo. (stuff that needs to done before upcoming release)
@ not exactly a high priority however we should prolly merge in a supposidly
  working/better userlist than the one we have right now. //zak

@ We need to fix the getusers handling, hell it needs an overhaul, any
  takers? //zak

@ we have too many bindings for dcc, perhaps we could set some sort of cycle
  for chat/accept/send, as i highly doubt more than one person would send
  some sort of dcc request at once in most cases, ie; use ctrl-t to accept
  both chat/files and ctrl-r to reject both chat/files? something to look
  into? //zak

@ cleanup oper module/rewrite portions/allow for more toggability of 
  some things alien88 likes blocked that others may too.
  we should discuss things among different admins/opers we know in some
  temp irc channel //zak (work in progress)

@ more documentation need some updating? //zak

## lower priority requests/todo.
@ Finish server list module, assigned to kreca (kreca check UPDATES)
  ^ Still incomplete as of 02.03.10 marking the date/year down should
   speed up kreca's slackness or maybe not //zak

@ Start assigning more sane hook numerics, they're all over the place
  which is something we pretty much inherited from oblivion. //zak

@ convert modules to the PF-Loader (the ones that have yet to be done)

@ add some topwin module, kreca has to start a discussion about some topwin
  script he might have permission for us to use/modify/rip ;)

@ make orignick use ISON functionality.. -Rylan

@ Add a way to match the ban/invite execption list against the current
  users in a channel. Requested by Tilt.


## Procrastinated requests.
@ add support to bwk to allow usage of wildcards.
@ fixdouble/fixwin or equiv for doublestats


## bugs fixed. / projects done.
02.03.10
! finish up or scrap the adcc module, i really hate to touch this myself
  i have never heard of a request for this module nor have i heard a single
  complaint about it working or not working perhaps a vote?
  @skullY I vote remove. If they need this they can run an eggdrop.
  gone for some time now i beleive, i forget how long, dont care, me
  happy //zak

01.23.10
! protect module is borked, fix? remove?
  @skullY I vote remove, Metoo, dead,gone junk useless not even pasture
  worthy //zak
  
2.13.08 - i beleive this has been done about a year ago kreca forgot to
	  update the file as usual. //zak
! Get some variables from numeric 005 so we can finetune some displays?
  EG, get nick length so we can have formatted publics and /who with proper
  output?

2.13.08 - finally got around to doing it /bhelp for info //zak
! add bans help documentation

1.24.08 - seems to work fine, let us know if any problems.
! add possible dcc_ports toggability, somewhat based off epic5/scripts.
   let me or kreca know if it works/causes problems/whatnot //zak
   (still untested for me really)

1.12.08 it's been set for default_realname/user, -snapshot is more for
	-cvs epic anyways. (were not adding backwards compat)
! fixup /set realname for default_realname and default_user should we
  if < ver, or break compatability? i vote for if < somever when it was
  added then do the old way of set realname.

1.31.07
! mmatrix module, /addword foobar #chan will not ban and kick user, just kick
  ^^ fixed prolly about a month or two ago //zak

10.21.06 - fixed by kreca 'getuhost' issue in alias.m -Rylan
! /ign seems to have interesting issues, recursion?? /ign foo-bar(nonexistent
  nick) spews Cannot pop operand: no more operands, looks like there's some
  hack to suppress even more errors a la ^?; math parser issue? -Rylan

9.14.06 seems to work fine, hopefully some will like this feature //zak
! make usage of $encode() for basic 'encryption' for awaylogs or some other
  new function that has yet to be investigated.

7.10.06 //skullY
! =nick= bug: if you use /msg nic<tab> and their nick ends in a \
  =nick= it prefixes it with another \, so it'll be nick\\

8/7/05 doesn't look like this is needed move to here votes closed. //zak
- maybe? for - glines...
  <@skullY> you could if ([$0]==[y] || [$0]==[yes]) //vote?

and of course!
UNSURPRISING BUG FIXES.
