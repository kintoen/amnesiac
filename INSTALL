before installing amnesiac remember this script is for epic it's not a
bitchx and or scrollz script or any other ircii based client but epic
first you should get epic from www.epicsol.org download it and compile it.
if you do not know what epic is then you don't need this irc script.

other notes:
Amnesiac should be fairly stable we're probably out of the ALPHA stage,
so BETA might be a better description of how well the script functions.

check the README NOTES TODO-BUGS EPIC-BUGS Files if you are experiencing any
weird problems/errors. more documents can also be found in ~/amn/docs
check these before reporting a bug!.

note:

only is the only access that the script has to get to work properly. All
save files will go to ~/.amn per default.

client issues, check the amnesiac irc support channel #amnesiac@efnet
