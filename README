* people who wish to see amnesiac source via cvsweb may do so here:
  http://cvs.epicsol.org/cgi/viewcvs.cgi/amn/

* As of 2.0.x release of amnesiac, it is now considered BETA, I dont
  expect to change this anytime soon, even in our releases ive always
  considered it BETA, When we make a release its usually for people
  who are paranoid, and want 'release' and package managers of various
  distributions usually need release where -current/-snapshot, may be
  frowned upon, regular users should probably update from cvs from time
  to time for bugfixes, cleanups etc. -cvs is considerd 'BETA/stable'

* The INSTALL file gives detailed instructions how to install amnesiac.

* The documents directory, contains misc documents for amnesiac and epic
  as well as the todo list, and knownbugs.

* The pasture directory, contains stuff some people may still want but has
  been removed. or for reference purpose.

* If you find a bug in amnesiac, please join one of our support channels
  primarily on efnet, to report a bug, or drop an email to the mailing

  this may help speed up fixing a bug in case i am not around or vice versa.
