# relaysmtp - Relay messages to and from irc using email

Using this script is currently a bit complicated. I'm working on ways to make
it simpler.

First, you need to setup your email system to get messages from email to your
irc client. I use procmail for this:

	# Handle IRC traffic
	:0:
	* ^From: <your email address>
	|/bin/sh $HOME/amn/modules/relaysmtp/addQueue.sh

If you have installed amnesiac in another location you will need to adjust 
both the procmail recipe and the addQueue.sh script.

This will allow you to send an email similar to the following:

	From: <your email address>
	To: <your username>+<password>+<irc nick>@<your irc host>

	Hello!

When this email is delivered it will result in your irc client sending a
/msg to the irc nick you specify. 

### Example

I have a sprint phone, which has an email address that looks like this:

	5105550420@messaging.sprintpcs.com

I first setup my procmail rule:

	# Handle IRC traffic
	:0:
	* ^From: 5105550420@messaging.sprintpcs.com
	|/bin/sh $HOME/amn/modules/relaysmtp/addQueue.sh

Then I configure relaying in my irc client (FIXME: write how to configure)
which will send out emails with the proper From address, so I can simply reply
to existing messages in my treo's threaded sms reader.

But wait, I need to ask zak something, and he hasn't messaged me yet. I'll
have to properly construct the email address! OH GNOEZ!

Luckily, it's not difficult. As we established when we configured the script
(no we didn't!) my password is currently "fnord". So I send the following
email:

	From: 5105550420@messaging.sprintpcs.com
	To: zwhite+fnord+zak@darkstar.frop.org

	Look at me! I'm ircing via my phone! Isn't that gay?

And, using magic, it gets relayed to zak.
