## various notes/documents about some common problems known in
## amnesiac/epic.


## ansi/ibm437 hardcoding fonts/ugly looking etc..
-this is not a bug per se, it's just how the font handles ansi codes. 
 i do not know what fonts really support them, these are some of the
 things you can try if your theme/colors/ansi etc.. in the client looks
 screwed up, also for european/non western languages users. there is a
 /latin1 alias which should fix your terminal to fix your native language
 characters however you cannot use an ansi theme (in most cases)
 best to use the vanilla or epic theme. for non-western language encodings.
 /ibm437 will try and enable ansi-like encodings on your terminal/putty/
 xterm/whatever. it is best to have a font that supports this, one such
 font i do know that supports it for rxvt/aterm/etc.. is the vga11x19
 font, most people do not like this font as this is huge on small screens
 ie; 1024x768 or 15" or less monitors, it can be grabbed from 
 http://amnesiac.ircii.org/misc/
 there are also some other fonts in there as well which may or may not work.

## terminfo/termcap info.
-terminfo/termcap issues on FreeBSD not sure about DragonFly... possible fix
 ln -s /usr/compat/linux/usr/share/terminfo /usr/share/misc 
 and cross your fingers? - help from |Rain| (naturally i presume this
 requires the linux-compat libs installed.)

## multiserver in amnesiac.
-there has been some improvements since 1.1 release
 it's been tested and known to work, at the time of this writing mjoin does
 not support multiple servers. auto_reconnect is now back by popular demand.

## putty/other terminals etc..
in putty make sure you have a proper font, usually i use lucida console
however i have heard some complaints it will still not display ansi properly
even if one selects ansi/oem modes and set font translation character set to
'use font encoding' in that case try the terminal font. if all else fails
one can try /fixterm and or /latin1

## bwk module has been merged into mmatrix /addmod mmatrix
we have broken backwards compatability with the old way it used to save
bwk, if you see issues do rm -rf ~/.amn/a.words.save /delmod mmatrix
/addmod mmatrix and retry, bug reports of this sort without doing
the above will be ignored.
