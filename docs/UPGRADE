Warning the following may screw up your script, remove precious savefiles or
render the client unusable, you have been warned.

## /adump info and why.
/adump is more of a scripters command, there are various usages of this cmd,
i.e when playing with /sets and or formats/sbars etc.. something went wrong
/adump will dump and reload/configure the script from it's last /save position
(basically last working config before it got messed up)

## Upgrading from 1.1x 1.2x to 1.3d 1.4d
rm -rf /path/to/amn
tar zxf newver.tgz (will normally uncompress in home dir, or current dir)
or if one wishes to specify where to put amn
tar zxf newver.tgz -C /path/to/where/you/want/it
/adump (in client)

## upgrading to snapshots
wget http://amnesiac.ircii.org/ac-snap.tgz
rm -rf /path/to/amn
tar zxf ac-snap.tgz (this will store in current dir usually home as amn)
or to specify where to put amn.
tar zxf ac-snap.tgz -C /path/to/preferred/place
/adump (in client)

NOTE: in some cases you may have to rm -rf ~/.amn in cases we may have
broke backwards compatability with some things.
ie; banwordkick(mmatrix module) and format settings(core client)
