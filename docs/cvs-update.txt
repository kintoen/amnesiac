Amnesiac Update using CVS

NOTE: amnesiac 1.5d rel 4 requires epic5 EPIC5-0.3.5 (20070917) [1520] 
      or better.
      -This requires at least amnesiac 1.5+ to work.

- The first time you want to update amnesiac with CVS, you need to go 
  to the top level directory and log into the CVS server:
  $ cd ~/amn
  $ cvs login
  Logging in to :pserver:anoncvs@prbh.org:2401/home/cvs/repository
  CVS password: anoncvs
  
  Finally, to update amnesiac just type:
  $ cvs update

NOTE: if you get a pass error, and or if you are running cvs for the
      first time on a particular account, you may need to touch ~/.cvspass
      if you run into errors.
