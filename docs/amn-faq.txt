Q: How do I get help documentation?
A: /ahelp for general amnesiac help, /ehelp to see what other help commands
   are available.
   NOTE: We need a better help system. Think you can do it? Come talk to us
   on EFNet #amnesiac.
   NOTE: see amn/docs for further documentation.
   NOTE: see http://www.prbh.org/help/ also ~help/ for epic specific help.

Q: How can I contribute?
A: We need documentation and testing. Come to EFNet #amnesiac if you find
   a bug. Even better if you can isolate it and provide a patch. If you
   write some documentation come to #amnesiac to get it comitted into the
   tree, if you used cvs to grab amnesiac, you can create recursive diffs
   (patches) for amnesiac: cd ~/amn && cvs -q diff -uR > amnesiac.patch

Q: Where can I get help?
A: The official amnesiac channel is on EFNet, #amnesiac. Don't ask if anyone
   is around, just ask your question. If no one can answer it right away then
   idle, someone will be around eventually.

Q: How do I switch channels?
A: Hit ^X to switch between channels and queries for the current window

Q: How do I make this look less gay?
A: /theme to see a list of themes, /theme <name> to switch themes. You can
   also change individual formats with /format.

Q: How do I load and unload modules?
A: /addmod to load a module, /delmod to remove a module, /listmod to see
   what's loaded, /vmod to see all the modules available. /emod to see more 
   detailed description about the module.

Q: How do I use windows?
A: /wj to join a channel in a new window, ^Wc to create a new window, ^Wn to
   move to the next window, ^Wp to move to the previous window, ^Wk to kill
   the current window, ^W<0-9> to switch to the specified window, /<0-9> to
   switch to the specified window. esc<0-9> to switch to specified window.
   /wk to kill current window.
   NOTE: We need better documentation on this. Any volunteers?
   NOTE: see also /winhelp

Q: How do i create a window dedicated to msgs?
A: /mw -hidden|split|kill <-- this should be self explanatory.

Q: Where is the annoying ambiguous nickcomplete feature?
A: Under a ideal world we would like to see users use tab to complete
   nicks in publics, whilest appending a : at the end of the specified
   completed nick. i.e if user crapple is in current channel, do
   hi cra<tab> which will complete the nick crapple or, cra<tab> : which
   usually completes the nick in question usually with a greater chance
   of accuracy, for those who want's the old nickcomplete and all of it's
   broken glory. /addmod ncomp to load the nickcomplete module /format r
   while choosing your poison don't forget to /save to keep your changes.

Q: What's the best way to change behavior that I don't like?
A: First, see if there's a /format or a /config for the behavior you want
   to change. If not, take a look at amn/modules/vanilla for an example
   of how to write a module to set behavior you like. or if its a simple
   alias of minor things put it in your ~/.epicrc

Q: How do i use notify?
A: /notify to view online/offline nicks if any.
   /notify nick will add specified nick to notify list.
   /notify -nick will remove specified nick from notify list.

Q: How do i ignore someone, what do the types mean?
A: /ign nick <type> if specified nick is online else
   /ign *!ident@*.isp.com <type>
   /tig to remove ignores.
   Some common ignore types. taken from epicsol.org's page.
   ctcps      filter in/out all CTCPs received
   invites    filter in/out all INVITEs received
   msgs       filter in/out all MSGs received (but not CTCPs)
   notes      filter in/out all NOTEs received
   notices    filter in/out all NOTICEs received
   public     filter in/out public channel conversation
   wallops    filter in/out operator WALLOPS
   topics     filter in/out all TOPIC changes
   nicks      filter in/out all NICK changes
   joins      filter in/out all channel JOINs
   parts      filter in/out all channel PARTs
   crap       filter QUIT, MODE, KICK and PONG
   all        everything listed above

Q: How do i ignore a channel?
A: /cig #channel or /cig for current chan.
   /tig to remove ignores.

Q: How do i enable/use auto_reconnect?
A: there are 3 different sets at the time of this writing to make the best
   use of reconnect.
   AUTO_RECONNECT is ON <-- settings are on/off on means it will attempt to
   reconnect you to another server if any during timeouts/kills etc.
   AUTO_RECONNECT_DELAY is 10 <--- time in seconds before retrying
   AUTO_RECONNECT_RETRIES is 3 <-- how many times to try before giving up

Q: why do the colours/font display properly?
A: see docs/NOTES for more detailed info, one can however try /fixterm or
   /latin1(european)

Q: How do i disable/toggle certain window notification?
A: /wnlevel none <-- disables notification
   /wnlevel publics,join,part <-- notify on public, join and parts

Q: how do i make use of the new userlist as of 02.27.07(approx)?
A: /adduser someuser *!someone@host1.com *!*other@host2.com
   /chflags someone aor <-- flags are auto-op, op, reop on deop on all
   channels/networks (as of this writing the multiserver capabilities are
   buggy, best to use global and or */#channel)
   also see: /userhelp /userlevels
   NOTE: the userlist of 02.27.07 apx, is buggy, a replacement is in the
   works.
