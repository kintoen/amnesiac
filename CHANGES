05.26.09

 Requested by: inittab. With help from: Skully
 //kreca

06.05.09
-Load amnesiac saved sets after all modules are loaded. 
 This makes sure that module added sets will save and load automatically. 
 Make use of this in the utf8 module. //kreca
-Add the ability to operview and mw to specify window number 
 (for hidden windows). Give operview the same syntax as mw 
 (-split,-hidden,-kill). If the window at that given already exists the flags 
 will be added to that specified window, otherwise it will be created at that
 number. 
 Requested by Alien88, hopefully he'll now fullfill my request/condition. 
 //kreca
