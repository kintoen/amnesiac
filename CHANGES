02.21.09
-Seed the random number generator where needed. //skullY

-rename some server helper aliases /svadd /svdel /ssl etc to name a few

-add more documentation into docs/NOTES, also put NOTES in primary amn
 directory, as more users may view it before asking questions about
 common documented things in NOTES

 epic5 release, apparently the behavior has been broken for some time that
 forced us to override it. //zak

03.23.09

david@efnet for this, thanks!
-merge in an statbar 4 customizations, cosmetic changes by wicked@efnet,

sir skullY's fault, blame him

-Add pattern matching to op deop voice devoice.

 Suggested by wicked, david and others, inspired by irssi apparently. //kreca

05.20.09
-Make putting /msg onto the blank input line when tab is pressed optional.
 This opens the door to make other commands the default. Suggested by inittab.
 //skullY
-Make a new "user requests" section in TODO-BUGS. //skullY

05.26.09

 Requested by: inittab. With help from: Skully
 //kreca

06.05.09
-Load amnesiac saved sets after all modules are loaded. 
 This makes sure that module added sets will save and load automatically. 
 Make use of this in the utf8 module. //kreca
-Add the ability to operview and mw to specify window number 
 (for hidden windows). Give operview the same syntax as mw 
 (-split,-hidden,-kill). If the window at that given already exists the flags 
 will be added to that specified window, otherwise it will be created at that
 number. 
 Requested by Alien88, hopefully he'll now fullfill my request/condition. 
 //kreca

06.06.12
-Reset keybindings on /adump. //skullY

06.18.09
-Add easykline script to oper module. To use this type /klineview [number] 
 and a special window for klines is created. Type help in that window (no slash)
 to see how it works. It's good for mass klining / fast klining. Inspired
 by http://www.garion.org/hosc/. (Public domain)
 //kreca

10.10.09
-Attempt to avoid flooding users with /whowas notifications per hop's
 recommendation. //skullY

-enable auto-reconnect per default *cringe* however its set to 120 secs
 instead of the previous 30, /ardelay 'int' to toggle reconnect delay.
-slight new aliasing in regards to  lastloging /lls llw lll see
 cvs diff for more changeinfo. //zak

12.12.09
-remove the hop alias which never worked. people should use /cycle instead. 
 thanks to slocate for finding this. //skullY

-01.05.10
-Happy new year!
-Add scan_users info to all scan format so it's easier to customize. 
 rb mongoose. //kreca

01.23.10
-No such thing as a new year while there sync copyrights
-Various cleanups-sorting of functions aliases.
-remove useless duplicate aliases we got too many shortened up
aliases that does the same thing, if someone really does use some short
'tough shit'. add to .epicrc
-remove core/more.m merge to core/exec.m slightly more appropriate.
-sync documentation to reality
-comment on ambiguous functionality that needs to be rewritten/cleaned up
and or thrown out alltogether. as we need to clean up a lot of objects
and put them in proper module/core for easier future debugging purposes.
-cvs diff to see minor changes not worthy of mentioning in CHANGES
-I would be pleasantly surprised if this commit does not come with some
- obvious screwup i probably made somewhere, users may want to test
before upgrading. //zak
-new statbar and themes and a whois, as well as some other format changes
 rb mongoose, if anything breaks, be sure to blame him TYVM
-remove protect module its junk, i have a better idea for a rewrite to be
planned before 2012, honest! //zak

-would have saveed me some trouble if kreca documented this somewhere
on people having some line drawing issues where i had to cvs log.
THANKS KRECA

----------------------------
revision 1.3
date: 2009/06/23 17:52:43;  author: kreca;  state: Exp;  lines: +32 -21
Oki, did a bugfix to the old code
Can someone that _was_ affected by the bug please type /set_line_drawing 1
and check how the sbars look after that.
please switch between
/eval set_line_drawing 1;sbar 1;
and
/eval set_line_drawing 0;sbar 1;
to see if there is any difference

-By popular demand add slight cosmetic - so it timestamps
- adminwall/locops/operwall - see amn/modules/oper/oper.m for current
setting feel free to modify it to your convienience and i will probably
commit the different cosmetic handling of it.
current output now shows something like.

Sa:22:19|LOCOPS: zak!zak@hippocratic.oaf/hub.deathwish.net - test
Sa:22:19|ADMINWALL: zak!zak@hippocratic.oaf/hub.deathwish.net - test
Sa:22:20|OPERWALL: zak!zak@hippocratic.oaf/hub.deathwish.net - test
Note: Timestamp conforms to /tform. //zak

01.27.10
-Cosmetic adjustment to operwall/adminwall/etc by mongoose!
-addition of quit/kick reasons rb mongoose!

02.03.10
-Major overhaul of eimodes.m(Now renamed to chanmodes.m along with bans.m)
 while there also complete the transform to the pf loader.
-added some new features this is just the beginning of quick mode handling
of +I/+e, built into the script, basic invite-exempts is complete, however
/iexempt rely's on /bantype until i get around to making a /invtype,
iexempt /iexempt <nick|nick1,nick2> adds invite exempt in current chan
ieh /ieh <nick|nick1,nick2> adds invite exempt of host on the fly
ieb /ieb <nick|nick1,nick2> adds invite exempt of better on the fly
ied /ied <nick|nick1,nick2> adds invite exempt of domain on the fly
iiexp /iiexp <nick|nick1,nick2> adds invite exempt of ident on the fly
see /smhelp for more info.
-remove ugly banners in recent addition into adminwal/operwall/locops
timestamping, however if one wants to use abecho or something, let me
know //zak
-some other minor cleanups of cruft that has no functional changes //zak
-sync some TODO-BUGS a bit more to reality //zak

02.04.10
-remove adcc for good from pasture //zak
-sync documents to reality, esp docs/PF-TODO
-sync epic5 UPDATES docs to reality, i guess somehow i must have
 missed this awhile back, or cvs ate it. //zak

02.18.10
-somehow during the merge of eimodes/bans.m into chanmodes.m bans.m did
not make it, also merge channel.m into chanmodes.m purging more duplicates
*sigh*, now amnesiac has /bk /bantype ban support etc again sorry for
the mess. //zak
-Also another note, between epic5 cvs 1620-21(server handling names got broken,
 it's fixed in 1622, but other bugs have now popped up cvs users of epic5 
 should stick with 1619, until the bugs are corrected. you can find a copy
 at http://amnesiac.ircii.org/epic5/cvs if you dont know how to revert with
 cvs.  //zak

02.19.10
-sync document to reality (mostly mailing list information), no functional
 changes //zak

02.21.10
-arrggghhh fix abot.m(specifically botsave) which has been broken for
 centuries yet no one reported it. also fix /bans output, _massmode* is
 slower than molasses, which kreca will be slapped and forced to rewrite.
 while in general area undo krecaisms. //zak

03.08.10
-queue up commands in _massmode alias and execute them all at once. this fixes
 the performance problems reported with mop/mdeop. Thanks to hop for
 helping me with the queue command //kreca

03.13.10
-gearing up for a release, while gearing up cleanup documentation, some
 serious bugs needs to be rectified see TODO-BUGS /ub broken, tab blankline
 does not load saved settings or something from $(savepath).tab.save //zak
-new toggability of /clones /btab //zak
-adjust our default fkey which we basically inherited from oblivion, set to
 use aliases that are in base or defaultmodules //zak
-remove core/users.m -> merged to scan.m which is more appropriate imho.
-remove core/version.m -> merged to core/hooks.m for very little lines in
 version.m, hooks.m seems like a better fit. //zak
-various cleanups //zak
 
03.14.10
-fix /ub alias. rb zak. //kreca

03.15.10
-fix tabblankmsg not loading save on startup, also replace xecho -b -> abwecho

 shiney new who handling(unformatted) /wholist /whotrace /chantrace latter
 two are are aliased to /wholist, another of /operspy, /cleargi(clear
 glines) many cosmetic additions/adjustments to server notice outputs. //zak
-IMPORTANT: amnesiac will only load on epic5(currently cvs) commit id
 1626 or better, for those who do not have cvs you may grab via web @
 http://amnesiac.ircii.org/epic5.cvs.id1626.tgz, or for those who are
 willing to risk a serious bug that came up in some previous epic5 releases
 you may comment the client check in amn/amn.epic, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
 //zak
-purge out our old shitlist/userlist from pasture it's useless/broken
 inherited from obvlivion //zak
-sync minor docs to reflect reality. //zak
-please test the oper module functionality, it does not mean it will stay it
 could very well be reverted, it needs testing, if its too much problems
 introduced the previous version of oper.m will come back, unchanged oper.m
 has been moved to pasture in case problems arises. //zak
